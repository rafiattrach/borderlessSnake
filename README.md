<h1> Brief Description </h1>

First small javascript project applying OOP concepts learned from java. I wanted to create a similar game to the snake game except there
are no borders so you'll just essentially come out of the opposite side. Also just wanted to implement the concept so instead of a snake and
the classical apple, its two boxes!
